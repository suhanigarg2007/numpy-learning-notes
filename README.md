ðŸ“˜ My Learnings on NumPy
This repository contains my complete learning notes and hands-on practice on NumPy, one of the core libraries in Python for numerical computing. Iâ€™ve documented all important concepts, functions, and experiments in a structured way using Kaggle notebooks.

ðŸ“š Credits
This work is based on the CampusX YouTube tutorial series on NumPy. I followed their structured videos and implemented every concept by hand to reinforce my learning.

ðŸ§  Topics Covered
ðŸ”¹ Basics & Array Creation
np.array, arange, linspace, zeros, ones, eye, full, copy

Array properties: shape, ndim, dtype, astype, itemsize

ðŸ”¹ Indexing & Iteration
Basic and advanced slicing (1D, 2D)

Boolean masking and conditions

Iterating with np.nditer

ðŸ”¹ Mathematical Operations
Element-wise arithmetic

Aggregations: min, max, sum, mean, median, std

dot product and using axis

ðŸ”¹ Random Number Generation
np.random.rand, randn, randint, seed, uniform

ðŸ”¹ Conditionals & Percentiles
np.where, np.percentile

ðŸ”¹ Array Manipulation
reshape, flatten, ravel, transpose

Stacking: hstack, vstack

Splitting: hsplit, vsplit

ðŸ”¹ Miscellaneous Utilities
Memory insights using import sys

Performance timing using import time

Simple plots using import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

âœ… Summary
Practiced all major NumPy functions with clean, working examples.

Gained deep understanding of how NumPy handles data, memory, and operations.
